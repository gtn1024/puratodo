# PuraToDo Tauri App - Progress Log

## Session 2: Authentication System Implementation
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Agent:** Claude Code

### Completed
- Implemented window controls (native Tauri controls work by default)
- Built complete login page UI with email/password fields
- Created authentication system:
  - API client with configurable base URL
  - Authentication store using Zustand with localStorage persistence
  - Login/register/logout API endpoints
  - useAuth hook for authentication operations
- Created Dashboard page placeholder for authenticated users
- Added auth state routing in App.tsx

### Current Status
- 3/209 test cases passing
- Authentication system implemented (requires API server for full testing)
- Login page ready with error handling
- Session persistence working

### API Configuration
Default API URL: http://localhost:3000
Can be configured via settings (Test #8, #9)

### Next Steps
1. Connect to running API server for login testing
2. Implement register page UI
3. Build sidebar with groups/lists
4. Implement task CRUD operations
