# PuraToDo Tauri App - Progress Log

## Session 0: Initial Framework Setup
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Agent:** Human + Claude Code

### Completed
- Created agent framework structure following Anthropic's long-running agent guide
- Created app_spec.txt with comprehensive Tauri app specification
- Created prompts/initializer_prompt.md for first session
- Created prompts/coding_prompt.md for subsequent sessions
- Created empty feature_list.json template (to be populated by Initializer Agent)
- Created init.sh environment setup script
- Created CLAUDE.md project guide

### Current Status
- Framework is ready for Initializer Agent
- feature_list.json is empty (needs 200+ features to be generated)
- Tauri project not yet initialized (src-tauri/ does not exist)
- No code has been written yet

### Next Steps
1. Run Initializer Agent to generate feature_list.json with 200+ test cases
2. Initialize Tauri project with Vite + React + TypeScript
3. Configure tauri.conf.json for all platforms
4. Begin implementing features one by one

### Notes
- This is a standalone application with its own React frontend
- Desktop platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux) are higher priority
- Mobile platforms (iOS, Android) can be developed in later sessions
- Connects to PuraToDo API (existing backend)
